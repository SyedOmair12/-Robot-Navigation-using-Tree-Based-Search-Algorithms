Implemented a command-line Java application to solve a robot navigation problem using various tree-based search algorithms, including:

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

A* Search

Custom Dijkstra-based Algorithms (CUS1 & CUS2)

The application reads a 2D map from file input and finds the optimal path from a start to a goal node using the selected search strategy. Emphasis was placed on performance, correctness, and clean path reconstruction. Designed for a university assignment with real-world applications in robotics and AI.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
Modular implementation of multiple search strategies

Custom priority queues for informed search algorithms

Efficient graph representation with adjacency lists

Visual path tracing and metrics logging

Robust error handling and file I/O
